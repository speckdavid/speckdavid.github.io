  abstract =     "<p>In classical planning, the task is to derive a sequence of deterministic actions that changes the current fully-observable world state into one that satisfies a set of goal criteria. Algorithms for classical planning are domain-independent, i.e., they are not limited to a particular application and instead can be used to solve different types of reasoning problems. The main language for modeling such problems is the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). Even though it provides many language features for expressing a wide range of planning tasks, most of today's classical planners, especially optimal ones, support only a small subset of its features. The most widely supported fragment is lifted STRIPS plus types and action costs. While this fragment suffices to model some interesting planning tasks, using it to model more realistic problems often incurs a much higher modeling effort. Even if modeling is possible at all, solving the resulting tasks is often infeasible in practice, as the required encoding size increases exponentially.</p>
  <p>To address these issues, we show how to support more expressive modeling languages natively in optimal classical planning algorithms. Specifically, we focus on symbolic search, a state-of-the-art search algorithm that operates on sets of world states. We show how to extend symbolic search to support classical planning with conditional effects, axioms, and state-dependent action costs. All of these modeling features are expressive in the sense that compiling them away incurs a significant blow-up, so is it often necessary to support them natively. Except for blind (non-symbolic) search, our new symbolic search is the first optimal classical planning algorithm that supports these three modeling extensions in combination, and it even compares favorably to other state-of-the-art approaches that only support a subset of the extensions.</p>"

  abstract =     "Shakey the robot was one of the first autonomous robots that 
                  showed impressive capabilities of navigation and mobile 
                  manipulation. Since then, robotics research has made great 
                  progress, showing more and more capable robotic systems for a 
                  large variety of application domains and tasks. In this letter, 
                  we look back on decades of research by rebuilding Shakey with 
                  modern robotics technology in the open-source Shakey 2016 
                  system. Hereby, we demonstrate the impact of research by 
                  showing that ideas from the original Shakey are still alive in 
                  state-of-the-art systems, while robotics in general has 
                  improved to deliver more robust and more capable software and 
                  hardware. Our Shakey 2016 system has been implemented on real 
                  robots and leverages mostly open-source software. We 
                  experimentally evaluate the system in real-world scenarios on 
                  a PR2 robot and a Turtlebot-based robot and particularly 
                  investigate the development effort. The experiments documented 
                  in this letter demonstrate that results from robotics research 
                  are readily available for building complex robots such as 
                  Shakey within a short amount of time and little effort."

  abstract =     "Over the last few decades, the systematic approach of 
                  knowledge transfer from biological concept generators to 
                  technical applications has received increasing attention, 
                  particularly because marketable bio-derived developments are 
                  often described as sustainable. The objective of this paper is 
                  to rationalize and refine the discussion about bio-derived 
                  developments also with respect to sustainability by taking 
                  descriptive, normative and emotional aspects into 
                  consideration. In the framework of supervised learning, a 
                  dataset of 70 biology-derived and technology-derived 
                  developments characterised by 9 different attributes together 
                  with their respective values and assigned to one of 17 classes 
                  was created. On the basis of the dataset a decision tree was 
                  generated which can be used as a straightforward 
                  classification tool to identify biology-derived and 
                  technology-derived developments. The validation of the 
                  applied learning procedure achieved an average accuracy of 
                  90.0%. Additional extraordinary qualities of technical 
                  applications are generally discussed by means of selected 
                  biologyderived and technology-derived examples with reference 
                  to normative (contribution to sustainability) and emotional 
                  aspects(aesthetics and symbolic character). In the context of 
                  a case study from the building sector, all aspects are 
                  critically discussed."
