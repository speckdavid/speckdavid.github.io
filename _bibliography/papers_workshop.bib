  abstract =     "<p>Many planning applications require not only a single solution but benefit substantially from having a set of possible plans from which users can select according to preferences. Surprisingly, planning research has primarily focused on quickly finding single plans for decades. Only recently have researchers started to investigate plan enumeration by top-k planning, offering more flexibility to the user. But simply enumerating the k best plans is far from targeted due to the time-consuming nature of enumeration, likely feeding many similar plans to the user, and forcing the user to define filters beforehand. In fact, in extensive search spaces, enumeration is hardly practical. We present an approach and a tool called PlanPilot to navigate solution spaces of planning tasks iteratively and interactively. We build on answer-set programming (ASP) to restrict the plan space. To that end, we employ facets, which are meaningful actions that appear in some, but not all plans. Enforcing or forbidding such facets allows for navigating even large plan spaces while ensuring desired properties quickly and step by step.</p>"

  abstract =     "<p>State-space reduction techniques are a powerful means to enhancing the performance of search-based planners. Recent work has shown that decoupled search, which compactly represents sets of states, can be cast as a task reformulation. Concretely, it is possible to exactly simulate the behavior and reduction of (non-optimal) decoupled search by applying a transformation to the input task and running regular search on the transformed task. In this work, we investigate if the same approach is feasible for symmetry breaking, in particular orbit space search (OSS). One of the challenges in this endeavor is that OSS dynamically computes a canonical representative of every state generated during search. To represent this computation as a task transformation, however, we need to fix the procedure at transformation time. This leads to reduced pruning potential, which we discuss in detail and verify empirically. We also discuss an approach that can fully simulate OSS, at the cost of vastly blowing-up the task size.</p>"

  abstract =     "<p>Since its proposal over a decade ago, LAMA has been considered one of the best-performing 
                  satisficing classical planners. Its key component is heuristic search with multiple open lists, 
                  each using a different heuristic function to order states. Even with a very simple, ad-hoc policy 
                  for open list selection, LAMA achieves state-of-the-art results. In this paper, we propose to use 
                  dynamic algorithm configuration to learn such policies in a principled and data-driven manner. On 
                  the learning side, we show how to train a reinforcement learning agent over several heterogeneous 
                  environments, aiming at zero-shot generalization to new related domains. On the planning side, our 
                  experimental results show that the trained policies often reach the performance of LAMA, and sometimes 
                  even perform better. Furthermore, our analysis of different policies shows that prioritizing states 
                  reached via preferred operators is crucial, explaining the strong performance of LAMA.</p>"

                  heuristics within one heuristic search. An aggregation of 
                  multiple heuristic estimates, for example by taking the 
                  maximum, has the disadvantage that bad estimates of a single 
                  heuristic can negatively affect the whole search. Since the 
                  performance of a heuristic varies from instance to instance, 
                  approaches such as algorithm selection can be successfully 
                  applied. In addition, alternating between multiple heuristics 
                  during the search makes it possible to use all heuristics 
                  equally and improve performance. However, all these approaches 
                  ignore the internal search dynamics of a planning system, 
                  which can help to select the most helpful heuristics for the 
                  current expansion step. We show that dynamic algorithm 
                  configuration can be used for dynamic heuristic selection 
                  which takes into account the internal search dynamics of a 
                  planning system. Furthermore, we prove that this approach 
                  generalizes over existing approaches and that it can 
                  exponentially improve the performance of the heuristic search. 
                  To learn dynamic heuristic selection, we propose an approach 
                  based on reinforcement learning and show empirically that 
                  domain-wise learned policies, which take the internal search 
                  dynamics of a planning system into account, can exceed

                  method called saturated cost partitioning that considers the

                  the remaining costs that it needs to preserve the heuristic

                  is subset-saturated transition cost partitioning that combines

                  prioritizing states that look more important during the
