  abstract =     "<p>Saturated cost partitioning (SCP) is one of the strongest methods for admissibly combining heuristics for optimal classical planning. The quality of an SCP heuristic depends heavily on the order in which its component heuristics are considered. For high accuracy, it is essential to maximize over multiple SCP heuristics computed using different component orders. However, for n component heuristics, even enumerating all n! orders is usually infeasible. Consequently, previous work resorted to using greedy algorithms and local optimization. In contrast, we present the first practical method for computing the perfect SCP heuristic that is equivalent to considering all component orders. We show that a set of SCP heuristics forms an additive disjunctive heuristic, which allows us to concisely represent component orders as a directed acyclic graph. Furthermore, once certain components have been considered, the order of the remaining components often becomes irrelevant. By exploiting this characteristic, we can reduce the size of the heuristic representation by several orders of magnitude in practice. Finally, our work makes it possible to compare the quality of existing SCP methods with that of the perfect SCP heuristic, revealing that existing approximations are nearly optimal for standard benchmarks.</p>"

  abstract =     "<p>Many planning applications require not only a single solution but benefit substantially from having a set of possible plans from which users can select, for example, when explaining plans. For decades, research in classical AI planning has primarily focused on quickly finding single plans. Only recently have researchers started to investigate preferences, enumerate plans by top-k planning, or count plans to reason about the plan space. Unfortunately, reasoning about the plan space is computationally extremely hard and feeding many similar plans to the user is hardly practical. To circumvent computational shortcomings while still being able to reason about variability in plans, faceted actions have been introduced very recently. These are meaningful actions that can be used by some plan but are not required by all plans. Enforcing or forbidding such facets allows for navigating even large plan spaces while ensuring desired properties quickly and step by step. In this paper, we illustrate an industrial challenge where reasoning with facets enables targeted plan space navigation. We present an approach to handle large plan spaces iteratively and interactively.</p>"

Therefore, state-of-the-art methods decompose the original task into subtasks---for example, one per goal atom---and compute an abstraction for each individual subtask. However, building a single abstraction suffers from diminishing returns, while building multiple abstractions loses information about how to achieve the associated subtasks jointly. We interpolate between these two extremes by first considering subtasks individually and then merging some of the resulting abstractions. We introduce an efficient algorithm for merging pairs of Cartesian abstractions using their refinement hierarchies and show that it yields more informative abstractions in less time than a naive approach. Furthermore, we prove that adding merged abstractions can only improve a cost-partitioned heuristic based on saturated post-hoc optimization and that for maximal heuristic values, we need to keep the individual abstractions. Our experiments show that merging abstractions drastically improves the resulting heuristics.</p>"

  <p>We present the first study to quantitative and qualitative reasoning on the plan space. In particular, we focus on polynomially bounded plans. On the theoretical side, we study its complexity, which gives rise to rich reasoning modes. Since counting is hard in general, we introduce the easier notion of facets, which enables understanding the significance of operators. On the practical side, we implement quantitative reasoning for planning. Thereby, we transform a planning task into a propositional formula and use knowledge compilation to count different plans. This framework scales well to large plan spaces, while enabling rich reasoning capabilities such as learning pruning functions and explainable planning.</p>"

However, its broad applicability is limited by the need for specialized algorithms. In this paper, we present an approach that embodies decoupled search for non-optimal planning through a novel task transformation. Specifically, given a task and a decomposition, we create a transformed task such that the state space of the transformed task is isomorphic to that of decoupled search on the original task. This eliminates the need for specialized algorithms and allows the use of various planning technology in the decoupled-search framework. Empirical evaluation shows that our method is empirically competitive with specialized decoupled algorithms and favorable to other related problem reformulation techniques.</p>"

                  to what extent state-dependent action costs are an essential

                  heuristics within one heuristic search. An aggregation of 
                  multiple heuristic estimates, for example by taking the 
                  maximum, has the disadvantage that bad estimates of a single 
                  heuristic can negatively affect the whole search. Since the 
                  performance of a heuristic varies from instance to instance, 
                  approaches such as algorithm selection can be successfully 
                  applied. In addition, alternating between multiple heuristics 
                  during the search makes it possible to use all heuristics 
                  equally and improve performance. However, all these approaches 
                  ignore the internal search dynamics of a planning system, 
                  which can help to select the most useful heuristics for the 
                  current expansion step. We show that dynamic algorithm 
                  configuration can be used for dynamic heuristic selection 
                  which takes into account the internal search dynamics of a 
                  planning system. Furthermore, we prove that this approach 
                  generalizes over existing approaches and that it can 
                  exponentially improve the performance of the heuristic 
                  search. To learn dynamic heuristic selection, we propose an 
                  approach based on reinforcement learning and show empirically 
                  that domain-wise learned policies, which take the internal

                  state-independent action costs. However, if a planning task 
                  features state-dependent costs, using a cost model with 
                  state-independent costs means either introducing a modeling 
                  error, or potentially sacrificing compactness of the model. 
                  In this paper, we investigate the conflicting priorities of 
                  modeling accuracy and compactness empirically, with a 
                  particular focus on the extent of the negative impact of 
                  reduced modeling accuracy on (a) the quality of the resulting

                  ignoring state-dependent costs can range, depending on the 
                  domain, from inexistent to several orders of magnitude.

                  is used, the specifics of how exactly the costs are

  abstract =     "<p>Symbolic representations have attracted significant 
                  attention in optimal planning. Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) 
                  form the basis for symbolic search algorithms. Closely related 
                  are Algebraic Decision Diagrams (ADDs), used to represent 
                  heuristic functions. Also, progress was made in dealing with 
                  models that take state-dependent action costs into account. 
                  Here, costs are represented as Edge-valued Multi-valued 
                  Decision Diagrams (EVMDDs), which can be exponentially more 
                  compact than the corresponding ADD representation. However, 
                  they were not yet considered for symbolic planning.</p>

                  <p>In this work, we study EVMDD-based symbolic search for 
                  optimal planning. We define EVMDD-based representations of 
                  state sets and transition relations, and show how to compute 
                  the necessary operations required for EVMDD-A*. This 
                  EVMDD-based version of symbolic A* generalizes its BDD 
                  variant, and allows to solve planning tasks with 
                  state-dependent action costs. We prove theoretically that our 
                  approach is sound, complete and optimal. Additionally, we 
                  present an empirical analysis comparing EVMDD-A* to BDD-A* and 
                  explicit A* search. Our results underscore the usefulness of 
                  symbolic approaches and the feasibility of dealing with models 
                  that go beyond unit costs.</p>"

  abstract =     "An agent that interacts with a nondeterministic environment 
                  can often only partially observe the surroundings. This 
                  necessitates observations via sensors rendering more 
                  information about the current world state. Sensors can be 
                  expensive in many regards therefore it can be essential to 
                  minimize the amount of sensors an agent requires to solve 
                  given tasks. A limitation for sensor minimization is given by 
                  essential sensors which are always required to solve 
                  particular problems. In this paper we present an efficient 
                  algorithm which determines a set of necessary observation 
                  variables. More specifically, we develop a bottom-up algorithm 
                  which computes a set of variables which are always necessary 
                  to observe, in order to always reach a goal state. Our 
                  experimental results show that the knowledge about necessary 
                  observation variables can be used to minimize the number of 
                  sensors of an agent."
