  abstract =     "<p>Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation of linear algebra, with applications ranging from quantum physics to artificial intelligence. Given its importance, enormous resources have been invested in the search for faster matrix multiplication algorithms. Recently, this search has been cast as a single-player game. By learning how to play this game efficiently, the newly-introduced AlphaTensor reinforcement learning agent discovers many new faster algorithms. In this paper, we show that finding matrix multiplication algorithms can also be cast as a classical planning problem. Based on this observation, we introduce a challenging benchmark suite for classical planning and evaluate state-of-the-art planning techniques on it. We analyze the strengths and limitations of different planning approaches in this domain and show that we can use classical planning to find lower bounds and concrete algorithms for matrix multiplication.</p>"

  abstract =     "<p>In classical planning, the goal is to derive a course of 
                  actions that allows an intelligent agent to move from any 
                  situation it finds itself in to one that satisfies its goals. 
                  Classical planning is considered domain-independent, i.e., it 
                  is not limited to a particular application and can be used to 
                  solve different types of reasoning problems. In practice, 
                  however, some properties of a planning problem at hand require 
                  an expressive extension of the standard classical planning 
                  formalism to capture and model them. Although the importance 
                  of many of these extensions is well known, most planners, 
                  especially optimal planners, do not support these extended 
                  planning formalisms. The lack of support not only limits the 
                  use of these planners for certain problems, but even if it is 
                  possible to model the problems without these extensions, it 
                  often leads to increased effort in modeling or makes modeling 
                  practically impossible as the required problem encoding size 
                  increases exponentially.</p>
                  
                  <p>In this thesis, we propose to use symbolic search for 
                  cost-optimal planning for different expressive extensions of 
                  classical planning, all capturing different aspects of the 
                  problem. In particular, we study planning with axioms, 
                  planning with state-dependent action costs, oversubscription 
                  planning, and top-k planning. For all formalisms, we present 
                  complexity and compilability results, highlighting that it is 
                  desirable and even necessary to natively support the 
                  corresponding features. We analyze symbolic heuristic search 
                  and show that the search performance does not always benefit 
                  from the use of a heuristic and that the search performance 
                  can exponentially deteriorate even under the best possible 
                  circumstances, namely the perfect heuristic. This reinforces 
                  that symbolic blind search is the dominant symbolic search 
                  strategy nowadays, on par with other state-of-the-art 
                  cost-optimal planning strategies. Based on this observation 
                  and the lack of good heuristics for planning formalisms with 
                  expressive extensions, symbolic search turns out to be a 
                  strong approach. We introduce symbolic search to support each 
                  of the formalisms individually and in combination, resulting 
                  in optimal, sound, and complete planning algorithms that 
                  empirically compare favorably with other approaches.</p>"

                  of our submission is the heuristic used to initialize newly 
                  encountered decision nodes. We apply an iterative symbolic 
                  backward planning approach based on the determinized task. 
                  Similarly to the SPUDD approach and recent work in symbolic 
                  planning with state-dependent action costs, we encode costs 
                  and reachability of states in a single decision diagram. 
                  During initialization, these diagrams are then used to query 
                  a state for its estimated expected reward. One benefit of this 
                  heuristic is that we can optionally interweave the standard 
                  heuristic of PROST, the IDS heuristic."
