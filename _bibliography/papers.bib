                  Bidirectional heuristic search algorithms have been around for a long time, 
                  but only recent advances have led to algorithms like BAE* that have the potential to 
                  outperform unidirectional heuristic search algorithms like A* in practice. In this work, 
                  we analyze BAE* for classical planning and the challenges associated with the underlying 
                  assumption of an explicit state representation. We show that it is crucial to use mutexes 
                  and reachability analysis to reduce the potentially exponential number of goal states, 
                  which makes it possible to create an explicit representation of a reversed planning 
                  task that can be used for the backward search of BAE*. Our empirical evaluation shows 
                  that BAE* solves more instances than A* in multiple domains with significantly fewer 
                  node expansions, demonstrating the usefulness of BAE* in planning.</p>"

                  actions that allows an intelligent agent to move from any 
                  situation it finds itself in to one that satisfies its goals. 
                  Classical planning is considered domain-independent, i.e., it 
                  is not limited to a particular application and can be used to 
                  solve different types of reasoning problems. In practice, 
                  however, some properties of a planning problem at hand require 
                  an expressive extension of the standard classical planning 
                  formalism to capture and model them. Although the importance 
                  of many of these extensions is well known, most planners, 
                  especially optimal planners, do not support these extended 
                  planning formalisms. The lack of support not only limits the 
                  use of these planners for certain problems, but even if it is 
                  possible to model the problems without these extensions, it 
                  often leads to increased effort in modeling or makes modeling 
                  practically impossible as the required problem encoding size 
                  increases exponentially.</p>
                  
                  <p>In this thesis, we propose to use symbolic search for 
                  cost-optimal planning for different expressive extensions of 
                  classical planning, all capturing different aspects of the 
                  problem. In particular, we study planning with axioms, 
                  planning with state- dependent action costs, oversubscription 
                  planning, and top-k planning. For all formalisms, we present 
                  complexity and compilability results, highlighting that it is 
                  desirable and even necessary to natively support the 
                  corresponding features. We analyze symbolic heuristic search 
                  and show that the search performance does not always benefit 
                  from the use of a heuristic and that the search performance 
                  can exponentially deteriorate even under the best possible 
                  circumstances, namely the perfect heuristic. This reinforces 
                  that symbolic blind search is the dominant symbolic search 
                  strategy nowadays, on par with other state-of-the-art 
                  cost-optimal planning strategies. Based on this observation 
                  and the lack of good heuristics for planning formalisms with 
                  expressive extensions, symbolic search turns out to be a 
                  strong approach. We introduce symbolic search to support each 
                  of the formalisms individually and in combination, resulting 
                  in optimal, sound, and complete planning algorithms that 
                  empirically compare favorably with other approaches.</p>"

                  maximum, has the disadvantage that bad estimates of a single 
                  heuristic can negatively affect the whole search. Since the 
                  performance of a heuristic varies from instance to instance, 
                  approaches such as algorithm selection can be successfully

  abstract =     "Symbolic search has proven to be a competitive approach to 
                  cost-optimal planning, as it compactly represents sets of 
                  states by symbolic data structures. While heuristics for 
                  symbolic search exist, symbolic bidirectional blind search 
                  empirically outperforms its heuristic counterpart and is 
                  therefore the dominant search strategy. This prompts the 
                  question of why heuristics do not seem to pay off in symbolic 
                  search. As a first step in answering this question, we 
                  investigate the search behaviour of symbolic heuristic search 
                  by means of BDDA*. Previous work identified the partitioning 
                  of state sets according to their heuristic values as the main 
                  bottleneck. We theoretically and empirically evaluate the 
                  search behaviour of BDDA* and reveal another fundamental 
                  problem: we prove that the use of a heuristic does not always 
                  improve the search performance of BDDA*. In general, even the 
                  perfect heuristic can exponentially deteriorate search 
                  performance."

                  In practice, such a set of best plans can be preferred to a 
                  single best plan generated by ordinary optimal planners, as 
                  it allows the user to choose between different alternatives 
                  and thus take into account preferences that may be difficult 
                  to model. In this paper we show that, in general, the decision 
                  problem version of top-k planning is PSPACE-complete, as is 
                  the decision problem version of ordinary classical planning. 
                  This does not hold for polynomially bounded plans for which 
                  the decision problem turns out to be PP-hard, while the 
                  ordinary case is NP-hard. We present a novel approach to top-k 
                  planning, called SYM-K, which is based on symbolic search, and 
                  prove that SYM-K is sound and complete. Our empirical analysis

                  heuristics within one heuristic search. An aggregation of 
                  multiple heuristic estimates, for example by taking the 
                  maximum, has the disadvantage that bad estimates of a single 
                  heuristic can negatively affect the whole search. Since the 
                  performance of a heuristic varies from instance to instance, 
                  approaches such as algorithm selection can be successfully 
                  applied. In addition, alternating between multiple heuristics 
                  during the search makes it possible to use all heuristics 
                  equally and improve performance. However, all these approaches 
                  ignore the internal search dynamics of a planning system, 
                  which can help to select the most helpful heuristics for the

                  state-independent action costs. However, if a planning task 
                  features state-dependent costs, using a cost model with

                  IPPC, PROST-DD is based on the trial-based heuristic tree 
                  search framework and applies the UCT* algorithm. The novelty 
                  of our submission is the heuristic used to initialize newly 
                  encountered decision nodes. We apply an iterative symbolic 
                  backward planning approach based on the determinized task. 
                  Similarly to the SPUDD approach and recent work in symbolic 
                  planning with state-dependent action costs, we encode costs 
                  and reachability of states in a single decision diagram. 
                  During initialization, these diagrams are then used to query 
                  a state for its estimated expected reward. One benefit of this 
                  heuristic is that we can optionally interweave the standard 
                  heuristic of PROST, the IDS heuristic."

  abstract =     "Shakey the robot was one of the first autonomous robots that 
                  showed impressive capabilities of navigation and mobile 
                  manipulation. Since then, robotics research has made great 
                  progress, showing more and more capable robotic systems for a 
                  large variety of application domains and tasks. In this letter, 
                  we look back on decades of research by rebuilding Shakey with 
                  modern robotics technology in the open-source Shakey 2016 
                  system. Hereby, we demonstrate the impact of research by 
                  showing that ideas from the original Shakey are still alive in 
                  state-of-the-art systems, while robotics in general has 
                  improved to deliver more robust and more capable software and 
                  hardware. Our Shakey 2016 system has been implemented on real 
                  robots and leverages mostly open-source software. We 
                  experimentally evaluate the system in real-world scenarios on 
                  a PR2 robot and a Turtlebot-based robot and particularly 
                  investigate the development effort. The experiments documented 
                  in this letter demonstrate that results from robotics research 
                  are readily available for building complex robots such as 
                  Shakey within a short amount of time and little effort."

  abstract =     "Over the last few decades, the systematic approach of 
                  knowledge transfer from biological concept generators to 
                  technical applications has received increasing attention, 
                  particularly because marketable bio-derived developments are 
                  often described as sustainable. The objective of this paper is 
                  to rationalize and refine the discussion about bio-derived 
                  developments also with respect to sustainability by taking 
                  descriptive, normative and emotional aspects into 
                  consideration. In the framework of supervised learning, a 
                  dataset of 70 biology-derived and technology-derived 
                  developments characterised by 9 different attributes together 
                  with their respective values and assigned to one of 17 classes 
                  was created. On the basis of the dataset a decision tree was 
                  generated which can be used as a straightforward 
                  classification tool to identify biology-derived and 
                  technology-derived developments. The validation of the 
                  applied learning procedure achieved an average accuracy of 
                  90.0%. Additional extraordinary qualities of technical 
                  applications are generally discussed by means of selected 
                  biologyderived and technology-derived examples with reference 
                  to normative (contribution to sustainability) and emotional 
                  aspects(aesthetics and symbolic character). In the context of 
                  a case study from the building sector, all aspects are 
                  critically discussed."

                  can often only partially observe the surroundings. This 
                  necessitates observations via sensors rendering more 
                  information about the current world state. Sensors can be 
                  expensive in many regards therefore it can be essential to 
                  minimize the amount of sensors an agent requires to solve 
                  given tasks. A limitation for sensor minimization is given by 
                  essential sensors which are always required to solve 
                  particular problems. In this paper we present an efficient 
                  algorithm which determines a set of necessary observation 
                  variables. More specifically, we develop a bottom-up algorithm 
                  which computes a set of variables which are always necessary 
                  to observe, in order to always reach a goal state. Our 
                  experimental results show that the knowledge about necessary 
                  observation variables can be used to minimize the number of 
                  sensors of an agent."
