  abstract  =    "<p>While state-dependent action costs are practically relevant 
                  and have been studied before, it is still unclear if they are 
                  an essential feature of planning tasks. In this paper, we study 
                  to what extent state-dependent action costs are an essential 
                  feature by analyzing under which circumstances they can be 
                  compiled away. We give a comprehensive classification for 
                  combinations of action cost functions and possible cost measures 
                  for the compilations.</p>

                  <p>Our theoretical results show that if both task sizes and 
                  plan lengths are to be preserved polynomially, then the 
                  boundary between compilability and non-compilability lies 
                  between FP and FPSPACE computable action cost functions (under 
                  a mild assumption on the polynomial hierarchy). Preserving 
                  task sizes polynomially and plan lengths linearly at the same 
                  time is impossible.</p>"
