  abstract =     "<p>Combinatorial reconfiguration studies how one solution of a combinatorial problem can be transformed into another. The transformation can only make small local changes and may not leave the solution space. An important example is the independent set reconfiguration (ISR) problem, where an independent set of a graph (a subset of its vertices without edges between them) has to be transformed into another one by a sequence of modifications that remove a vertex or add another that is not adjacent to any vertex in the set. The 1st Combinatorial Reconfiguration Challenge (CoRe Challenge 2022) was a competition focused on the ISR problem. Our team participated with two solvers that model the ISR problem as a planning problem and employ different planning techniques for solving it. They successfully competed in the challenge and were awarded 4 first, 3 second, and 3 third places across 9 tracks. In this work, we present the ISR problem as a new problem to the planning community and describe the planning techniques used in our solvers. We re-ran the entire competition under equal computational conditions to allow for a fair comparison. Besides showcasing the success of planning technology, we hope that this work will create a cross-fertilization of the two research fields.</p>"

  abstract =     "<p>Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation of linear algebra, with applications ranging from quantum physics to artificial intelligence. Given its importance, enormous resources have been invested in the search for faster matrix multiplication algorithms. Recently, this search has been cast as a single-player game. By learning how to play this game efficiently, the newly-introduced AlphaTensor reinforcement learning agent discovers many new faster algorithms. In this paper, we show that finding matrix multiplication algorithms can also be cast as a classical planning problem. Based on this observation, we introduce a challenging benchmark suite for classical planning and evaluate state-of-the-art planning techniques on it. We analyze the strengths and limitations of different planning approaches in this domain and show that we can use classical planning to find lower bounds and concrete algorithms for matrix multiplication.</p>"

  abstract =     "A key challenge in satisficing planning is to use multiple 
                  heuristics within one heuristic search. An aggregation of 
                  multiple heuristic estimates, for example by taking the 
                  maximum, has the disadvantage that bad estimates of a single 
                  heuristic can negatively affect the whole search. Since the 
                  performance of a heuristic varies from instance to instance, 
                  approaches such as algorithm selection can be successfully 
                  applied. In addition, alternating between multiple heuristics 
                  during the search makes it possible to use all heuristics 
                  equally and improve performance. However, all these approaches 
                  ignore the internal search dynamics of a planning system, 
                  which can help to select the most helpful heuristics for the 
                  current expansion step. We show that dynamic algorithm 
                  configuration can be used for dynamic heuristic selection 
                  which takes into account the internal search dynamics of a 
                  planning system. Furthermore, we prove that this approach 
                  generalizes over existing approaches and that it can 
                  exponentially improve the performance of the heuristic search. 
                  To learn dynamic heuristic selection, we propose an approach 
                  based on reinforcement learning and show empirically that 
                  domain-wise learned policies, which take the internal search 
                  dynamics of a planning system into account, can exceed 
                  existing approaches in terms of coverage."

                  multiple heuristics for state-space search. We use a greedy 
                  method called saturated cost partitioning that considers the 
                  heuristics in sequence and assigns the minimal fraction of 
                  the remaining costs that it needs to preserve the heuristic 
                  estimates. In this work, we address the problem of using more 
                  expressive transition cost functions with saturated cost 
                  partitioning to obtain stronger heuristics. Our contribution 
                  is subset-saturated transition cost partitioning that combines 
                  the concepts of using transition cost functions and 
                  prioritizing states that look more important during the 
                  search. Our empirical evaluation shows that this approach 
                  still causes too much computational overhead but leads to more 
                  informed heuristics."
