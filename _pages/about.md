I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href='https://uni-freiburg.de/?set_language=en'>University of Freiburg</a>, Germany.
My primary research interest is in the field of artificial intelligence, with a focus on the area of automated planning, i.e., the problem of finding a course of action that allows an intelligent agent to move from any situation it finds itself in to one that satisfies its goals.

<!--<h3>Short Bio</h3>-->
I completed my bachelor's degree in 2015 and my master's degree in 2018 in computer science at the <a href='https://uni-freiburg.de/?set_language=en'>University of Freiburg</a>. 
From April 2018, I have been a scientific employee and PhD student at the University of Freiburg at the <a href="https://gki.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/">Chair of Foundations of Artificial Intelligence</a> of <a href="https://gki.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~nebel/">Prof. Dr. Bernhard Nebel</a>.
In February 2022, I have received my PhD with the thesis <a href="assets/pdf/speck-phd2022.pdf">Symbolic Search for Optimal Planning with Expressive Extensions</a>.
