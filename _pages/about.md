I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Basel, Switzerland. My primary research interest is in the field of artificial intelligence, with a focus on automated planning, i.e., the problem of finding a course of action that allows an intelligent agent to move from any situation it finds itself in to one that satisfies its goals.

<h2>Short Bio</h2>
I completed my bachelor’s degree in 2015 and my master’s degree in 2018 in computer science at the University of Freiburg. From April 2018 to May 2022, I was a scientific employee at the University of Freiburg, Germany, at the Chair of <a href="https://gki.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/">Foundations of Artificial Intelligence</a> of Prof. Dr. Bernhard Nebel and received my PhD (Dr. rer. nat.) in February 2022. From June 2022 to May 2024 I was part of the <a href="https://mrlab.ai">Machine Reasoning Lab</a> as a postdoctoral researcher at Linköping University, Sweden. Since June 2024, I have been part of the <a href="https://ai.dmi.unibas.ch/">Artificial Intelligence research group</a> team at University of Basel, Switzerland.
